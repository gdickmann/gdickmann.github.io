## "Why I created this blog" first post.

At first, I wanted to create my own blog from the scratch. I opened my terminal, executed a new React application and gave up when I looked at the framework icon. I thought about how many front-end related things I would have to write and just closed everything.       

But now I'm using this template that does everything that I need: write about random things that comes to my mind.

I'm creating this blog because I want to leave my thoughts on some topics on the internet. I also like to talk about my personal projects.        

As I'm still not a influencer with 1kk followers, I won't be an active poster. For now, I'm just doing it for fun and because I like the way I explain things. I think I'm good at it.
