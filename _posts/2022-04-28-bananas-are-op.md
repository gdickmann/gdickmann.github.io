## Bananas are OP. Here's why.

I never was a fruit guy. To be honest, I remember eating fruits with more frequency when I was about ~ 10 years old. After that, I (not proudly) didn't eat too much
fruits. And yeah, I mean *ANY* kind of fruit. Also, I mean any fruit at all. Not even a Banana (note that it's 'Banana', not 'banana', because now I'm conviced that Bananas are a kind of divinity) - which I remembered yesterday how good it was.

## Why Bananas are OP.

Yesterday I was hanging out with two friends of mine when I needed to eat something before college. I generally buy some junkie foods and don't care at all, but these two friends are healthy and happy people. One of them suggested to buy two Bananas and an apple (note that it's 'apple', not 'Apple', because apple isn't a divinity for me - *not a diss for Apple, the company*). Of course that I laughed at them at first, but then I started to really take this idea into account. Was when I, for the first time after I don't know how many years, went to buy a Banana. Now, a few things to consider.

## Bananas are really cheap.

That was the first thing that I noticed when I bought them. 2 Bananas did cost 0,98 brazilian bucks! One of my friends also said that it was too expansive, but who cares? 0,98 for TWO beautiful and colorful Bananas. I took them. Then I bought the apple, that cost me 2,95 bucks. And that's it, everything worked fine.

## Bananas design are genius.

Stop and think about it. A natural fruit have such a genius design. You look at a Banana and you already know how it works, you know what you're supposed to do.

First, the Banana peel protect the fruit. Besides protecting it, the peel contains NUTRIENTS!!! There is literally no downside - at least as far as I know. I never ate the peel and I don't know if I want to, but just the fact that Banana's shield contains nutrients is an incredible thing.
Second, the shape of a peeled Banana is satisfying to look at. When you're eating something beautiful, you naturally want more of that food. That's the case of Bananas.

## Bananas are tasty

Genuine question: Is there someone in this life that doesn't like Bananas taste? Someone that says: "Oh, well, I don't like the sweet of Bananas. I prefer Apples!". Honestly, I don't think so. Bananas taste are just incredible, everything is balanced. That means that you can eat something healthy and that is tasty. Again, another incredible point from Bananas.

## Bananas can be used as fertilizer

Simply amazing. Can you understand that? You eat the Banana but you still got the peel. You don't need to necessarily throw it away in a trash, you can just throw it around plants. There are better ways to use Banana peel as fertilizer, but this will not harm the environment. +10 points for Bananas.

## Banana is synonymous of chimpanzees, the smarter animal before us.

Some haters may say that we "think that chimpanzees eat Bananas" because they are grown in tropical areas, where chimpanzees usually live. You can believe in that if you have an average IQ, but if you think more about it, you realize that chimpanzees eat Bananas (and are their preferred fruit) because they know everything that you're reading. They know how OP Bananas are and know that they get advantage eating a fruit like that.

Why do you think that hippos aren't smart as chimpanzees? The only accepted answer is because they don't eat Bananas as chimpanzees do. Simple like that.

## Bananas are healthy

Last but not least, Bananas are very healthy. It has high levels of potassium, which helps regulate water levels in the body. It is rich in vitamins, namely A, C, E and the B complex. It also has essential minerals such as calcium, zinc, magnesium, and more. How can something be good and healthy? OP.

## Conclusion

Bananas are a kind of God-fruit. They have beautiful design, are tasty and healthy. I'm not trying to convice you to eat Bananas and being healthy, I'm just saying facts.
